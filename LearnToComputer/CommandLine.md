# Learning the Command Line

As a Software Developer, it is important to understand how your computer works.  Understanding the underlying filesystem structure and how to navigate it goes a long way in this regard.  A great way to increase your understanding of these concepts is learning how to navigate your computer using the command line terminal. And, as an added bonus, it will be way faster than using the provided GUI for exploring your computer once you get the hang of it.

We generally recommend that developers use a Linux/Unix environment (MacOS is Unix-based as well).  If you use a Windows computer, you can dual boot a Linux Operating System (OS) (i.e. Fedora, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.), or you can set up a Virtual Machine (VM) through a free software (i.e. VirtualBox) or a paid one (i.e. VMWare).  However, if you are intent on sticking with Windows, there are tutorials out there for that as well.
