# Welcome to the Code4Baltimore learning center!

The two primary frameworks we’re working right now are *Node.JS* (back-end) and *React.JS* (front-end).  We’ve created a series of resources that helped us learn these frameworks and hopefully they’ll help you.

Click on the folder above that corresponds to the framework you want to learn.  Read the README document in the folder first and follow the steps to success.
