# Welcome to the Code4Baltimore learning center!

The two primary frameworks we’re working right now are *Node.JS* (back-end) and *React.JS* (front-end).  We’ve created a series of resources that helped us learn these frameworks and hopefully they’ll help you.

Click on the folder above that corresponds to the framework you want to learn.  Read the README document in the folder first and follow the steps to success.   

'''

Prior to learning Node or React you need a familiarity with Javascript.  The resources in these folders provide you with links to easy-to-learn tutorials to get you coding in no time.
