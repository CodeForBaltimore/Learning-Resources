# Welcome to the Code4Baltimore learning center!

This repo contains resources to help you learn the technologies which will allow you to contribute to our current projects as a programmer.  However, we always need contributions from designers, project managers, visionaries, and leaders as well!

The two primary frameworks we are working with right now are *Node.JS* (back-end) and *React.JS* (front-end).  We’ve compiled a series of resources that helped us learn these frameworks and hopefully they’ll help you.

Click on the folder above that corresponds to the framework you want to learn.  Read the README document in the folder first and follow the steps to success.

```
Prior to learning Node or React you need a basic understanding of Javascript.
If you do not have JavaScript experience, you may want to begin with the JavaScript resources.
If you do not have any coding experience, or have not used Git, you may want to start in the Learn to Computer folder.
```
