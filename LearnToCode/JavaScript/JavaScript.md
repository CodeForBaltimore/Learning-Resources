# Javascript

JavaScript is an interpreted prototype-based, weakly typed programming language that supports event-driven, functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.  A common misconception is that JavaScript is a based from the Java programming language but that is not true.  **Java is to JavaScript as Ham is to Hamster.**

JavaScript is standardized by the ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) and thereby officially named ECMAScript or ES.  ECMA continues to release functionality for JavaScript by major version numbers and more recently by years starting with ES6/ES2015.  ES6 marked a major functionality expansion in JavaScript.  ES6 is sometimes used to describe everything including and after ES6, including ES7/2016, ES8/2017, etc...  A new label of ES.Next is used to describe the latest additions to JavaScript.

Below is "Hello World" example that you can run right in your browser's developer tools console.

```js
alert("Hello World");
```

## Installing JavaScript

JavaScript does not require a specific installation to start using it outside of a web browser.  

### Web Browsers

When you install a web browser, it comes with a JavaScript runtime installed.  Some of the most popular web browsers are:

* Chrome / Chromium - MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android
* Firefox - MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android
* Opera - MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android
* Brave - MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android
* Safari / Mobile Safari - MacOS, iOS
* Edge / Internet Explorer - Windows

### Web Based 

Over the past few years, online development environments have exploded.  You can program javascript in these environments without the need to setup anything locally on your computer.  Some of them have the ability to import frameworks as well and even CodeSandbox has the option to use Visual Studio Code in the browser.  Here is a list of some of the popular options:

* [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
* [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)
* [REPL>it](https://repl.it/)
* [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
* [Cloud9 by AWS](https://c9.io/)

### Local Installation

For a local installation you will need to install a code editor and Node.js.  Visit the [Learning Node](../Node.js/NodeJS.md) for installation instructions.  Some of the most common code editors are:

* [Visual Studio Code (aka VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - MacOS, Windows, Linux
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - MacOS, Windows, Linux
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - MacOS, Windows, Linux
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) - MacOS, Windows, Linux

*_There are plenty of options for code / text editors, but some are OS specific.  The options above are specifically available on MacOS, Windows, and Linux_*
