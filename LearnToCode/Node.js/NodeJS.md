# Learning React

## Beginners
The following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A71aqufiNtQ&t=6m33s) offers an excellent walkthrough for getting your environment up and running with React and learning the basics.  

## Advanced Learners
This [video series](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/starting-with-reactjs/100000006A0454/060601.html) may be worth looking into through Safari Books online.  The pace is quick but it shows you the whole React lifecycle.    You can set up a one-month free trial or if you have a Baltimore library card the account may be free.

## Other Resources
The following [book](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Functional-Development-Redux/dp/1491954620) is excellent for learning React but importantly, it starts with the latest additions to Javascript as part of Es6 (Object constructors, arrow functions, and more.)
